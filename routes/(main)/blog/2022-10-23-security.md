# Security

For any developer, there are two common security keys; SSH keys and PGP keys.
These are quick notes on the 2 to cut through the noise.

## PGP

PGP is the standard, [it has an RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880).
Don't confuse it with GPG or [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org) which is an
_implementation_ of PGP. GnuPG commands will be used a lot below.

The easiest way to generate a key is:

```bash
export IDENTITY_EMAIL=user@example.com
export ENC_TYPE=ed25519  # rsa4096 is okay
export LENGTH=2y  # good default, change to suit your security needs
export USAGE=sign # maybe can change this (like to have the encryption key be the same, but sign is the default

# this will prompt for an optional passphrase, it can be left blank.
gpg --yes --quick-generate-key $IDENTITY_EMAIL $ENC_TYPE $USAGE $LENGTH

# only works with a brand new keystore, otherwise the tail/head lines will be off.
export FINGERPRINT=$(gpg -k | tail -3 | head -1 | xargs echo)

# creates an encryption sub key
gpg --yes --quick-add-key $FINGERPRINT $ENC_TYPE

# export the public key to a shareable format.
# if you need to export the private key, change `--export` to `--export-secret-keys`
gpg --export --export-options backup --armor --output ~/$IDENTITY_EMAIL.public.key $FINGERPRINT
```

After running these commands, the raw key data will be in `~/.gnupg`, but this
can be changed.

```bash
# individual command
gpg --homedir /somewhere/else/.gnupg

# all commands
export GNUPGHOME=/somewhere/else/.gnupg
```

### Testing PGP Functions

```bash
# encrypt
echo "test message string" | gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient $FINGERPRINT -o encrypted.txt

# decrypt, the yubikey must be inserted, you'll need to enter the PIN.
gpg --decrypt --armor encrypted.txt

# sign, you need yubikey and PIN.
echo "test message string" | gpg --armor --clearsign > signed.txt

# verify
gpg --verify signed.txt
```

## SSH

SSH keys are separate and typically used for connecting to other servers to
issue commands or copy files.

```bash
export IDENTITY_EMAIL=user@example.com
export ENC_TYPE=ed25519

ssh-keygen -t $ENC_TYPE -f ~/.ssh/${IDENTITY_EMAIL}_id_ed25519 -C $IDENTITY_EMAIL

# or RSA for older servers
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f $KEY_NAME -C $KEY_NAME
```

## Alternatives?

There is some agreement in communities that PGP has footguns and can be painful
to deal with. But it is still the industry standard. A viable alternative
doesn't exist, yet.

However, progress is being made in areas. Modern encryption solutions like
[age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) are gaining popularity and may become
viable one day. It seems to fit most use cases I come across where I need to
reach for PGP. But as the age author has pointed out,
[it doesn't do everything](https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/age-authentication/)
(only fair to say, it was never the author's intent for age to do everything).
