Hi, I'm Sean Stiglitz. Software engineer by day, software engineer by night.

I created this website for hosting my general contact information, blog
postings, or anything else I may want to build. It is built using
[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev)/[picocss](https://picocss.com) and hosted on
Deno Deploy. The code is open source and can be found
[here](https://github.com/sstiglitz/personal-site).
