# Fresh project

Your new Fresh project is ready to go. You can follow the Fresh "Getting
Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

### Styles

This uses [picocss](https://github.com/picocss/pico/tree/v2). It is installed
manually by downloading the latest package, then running
`unzip -j ~/Downloads/pico-2.zip pico-2/css/pico.min.css -d ~/dev/personal-site-deno/static`.
