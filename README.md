Hi, this is my personal website.

### Setup

To setup the site, I used the [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) starter template
found on their website, `deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev`, then began
modifying from there.

### Styles

The site uses [picocss](https://github.com/picocss/pico/tree/v2). It is
installed manually by downloading the latest package, then running
`unzip -j ~/Downloads/pico-2.zip pico-2/css/pico.min.css -d ~/dev/personal-site-deno/static`.
